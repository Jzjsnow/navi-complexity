# Quantifying navigation complexity in transportation networks
Zhuojun Jiang, Lei Dong, Lun Wu, and Yu Liu

## Abstract
The complexity of navigation in cities has increased with the expansion of urban areas, creating challenging transportation problems that drive many studies on the navigability of networks. However, due to the lack of individual mobility data, large-scale empirical analysis of the wayfinder's real-world navigation is rare. Here, using 225 million subway trips from three major cities in China, we quantify navigation difficulty from an information perspective. Our results reveal that 1) people conserve a small number of repeatedly used routes, and 2) the navigation information in the sub-networks formed by those routes is much smaller than the theoretical value in the global network, suggesting that the decision cost for actual trips is significantly smaller than the theoretical upper limit found in previous studies. By modeling routing behaviors in growing networks, we show that while the global network can become difficult to navigate, navigability can be improved in sub-networks. We further present a universal linear relationship between the empirical and theoretical search information, which allows the two metrics to predict each other. Our findings demonstrate how large-scale observations can quantify real-world navigation behaviors and aid in evaluating transportation planning.

### Route matching

To generate the route matching results using the provided scripts, run in the terminal:
```linux
$ python route_matching.py 
```
The output will be in `output/`.

### Calculate the empirical search information (ESI) 

To generate the ESI results based on the matched path from the OD records, run in the terminal:
```linux
$ python ESI_from_matching.py
```
The output will be in `output/ESI`.

When no smart card data (matched paths) are available from 2000 to 2020, the ESI of the subway networks is calculated using the k shortest paths for each year (Beijing: k=13, Shanghai: k=12, Shenzhen k=6, see paper for detail).
To generate the ESI results based on the k shortest paths, run in the terminal:
```linux
$ python ESI_from_ksp.py
```

### Calculate the theoretical search information (TSI) 
Reproduce the amount of theoretical global search information according to [Gallotti et al, 2016](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500445).

To generate the TSI results using the provided scripts, run in the terminal:
```linux
$ python TSI.py
```
